# DataCleaningProgrammingAssignment1
Programming assignment for Coursera R data cleaning course

The data set included in this submission presents a summary of the 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset', Version 1.0, from experiments conducted by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto and Xavier Parra in 2012.

In these experiments, 30 volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone on their waist. The smartphone recorded 3-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity measurements. This formed the basis for the original data set.

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A
